        <h1>Warning!</h1>

        <p>
            This particular version of Navigator, <em>Navigator Recorder</em>, sends us information on how you use it.
            If you choose to use Navigator Recorder, you accept that we may publish such data for the whole world without you retaining any rights to the data.
            We do not promise to publish the data, though.
            Sweet deal, eh?
        </p>

        <h2>"Say what!?"</h2>
        <p>
            We are in a dire need of raw data to create new features, for example to give you smart directions or to figure out whether you are currently walking or sitting in a bus.
            You can pitch in by providing us with data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Navigator Recorder lives in a <a href="https://github.com/HSLdevcom/navigator-proto/tree/feature/user-recording">separate branch</a> of Navigator code.
            No tracking is done for the other Navigators so if the data collection bothers you, use <a href="http://dev.hsl.fi/">those</a> instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the data we need is <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/locational-privacy">very private</a>, you need to understand what you will give us if you use Navigator Recorder.
            Among other minor information, Navigator Recorder will <strong>continuously</strong> collect
                <ul>
                    <li>your location, timestamped,</li>
                    <li>your browser User-Agent and</li>
                    <li>(PLANNED) your route options and route choices.</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The collected data may eventually be available to
                <ul>
                    <li>your mom,</li>
                    <li>your spouse,</li>
                    <li>your boss or</li>
                    <li>anyone.</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to help us, you will still retain some control as you will initially have to flip the recording switch to start the recording.
            If you flip the switch again, the recording stops.
            Note that the position of the switch is remembered the next time you use Navigator Recorder.
